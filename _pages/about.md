I am specialized in **Embedded Machine Learning** and Deep Learning (aka TinyML) for ultra-low power IoT sensor devices, and _multi-core RISC-V Microcontrollers_ in particular. 
My contributions concern low-bitwith quantization methods and optimized software frameworks for inference on MCUs. 
I have also worked on full-system integration of smart audio or video sensor solutions with a power consumpions as low as few mWs (with [GreenWaves Technologies](https://greenwaves-technologies.com/)). 

Recently, my research interest has moved towards **On-Device Learing** to improve at runtime the predicion capacitiy of IoT smart senors.
In this space, I am investigating software integration of training algorithm on MCUs and efficient (continual) learning strategies for resource-constrained platoform. 
Thanks to my [EU-funded Marie-Curie grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101067475) (done at KU Leuven with [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/TT)), I am now studying novel adaptation mechanisms for ultra-low power speech recognition sensors ([SEA2Learn project]()).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
